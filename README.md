# Arc boost for Canvas

This is a simple Arc boost for the Canvas app by Instructure, which I'm submitting to the first Arc mini-hackathon.

## Usage

1. Create a new boost with `cmd + t` -> `new boost`
2. Click `Custom`
3. Click `A specific website` and enter `instructure.com`
4. Paste the contents of `content.js` into `content.js` and `styles.css` into `styles.css`
5. Reload any previously opened Canvas sites
